# DifferentiableChemistry
This is the repository for the code of my master thesis "Deep learning for computational chemistry with differentiable background knowledge"

The code is structured in a couple of scripts each representing some part of the implementation. Models are stored in `models.py`, while chemical and subgraph rules are in `chemrules.py`. The training pipeline as well as other details are in `pipeline.py`.
