# DifferentiableChemistry
This is the repository for the code of my master thesis "Deep learning for computational chemistry with differentiable background knowledge"

## Project Structure
The code is structured in a couple of scripts each representing some part of the implementation. 
Models are stored in `models.py`, while chemical and subgraph rules are in `chemrules.py`. 
Dataset files are stored in `datasets` folder, while they are loaded and parsed in `datasets.py`.
The training pipeline as well as other details are in `pipeline.py`.


*Have in mind that the code is just a first working draft, it will be updated to address possible issues, as well as to document it properly.*
